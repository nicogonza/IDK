The web application that makes the classroom more interactive and stress-free. Students will use this app during slideshow presentations. If students are confused on the professor's explanation of topic, they can submit a "I Don't Know" response. The professor will have real-time analytics of how many students that do not understand what the professor is explaining. This will allow students to speak out when no one wants to about a difficult topic. We utilized GitHub (Version Control).
